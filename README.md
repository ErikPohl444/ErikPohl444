<summary>About my Python repos:</summary>

  # Python Repositories Summary

## Pythons can move 1 mile per hour on the flat ground.

This is just one of many interesting things about pythons.

## This repo shows an evolution

![Tools! Tools?](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/blob/master/media/evolu.png "Tools! Tools?")

What you see here is some work I did a while back in Python, before I: 
* managed a team of Python engineers
* tooled technical implementations with enterprise customers onto a SaaS system in Python so I'd automate the difficult parts away-- allowing me to have more information to talk to the customers
* became a tech lead for a project involving a customer moving to the cloud from an on-prem system, one involving Angular and Node  

Back when I wrote these, I was quickly evolving my style from "able to solve complex problems in Python reliably" more towards "writing Python I'd submit for a production code review".

I'm was learning, researching Python-particular coding patterns (even learning from anti-patterns), to refine my code style.  [I am still learning!]

The most representative work back then was recent work at the time:

_JnesaisQ_

_list_of_xs_sorter_

As time permits, I'd like to continue my work building on these so they work together and so the list_of_Xs_sorter uses a design pattern to handle all of the different lists of Xs it can sort.
As I move forward, I will go back and refactor for style and clarity my former work, including adding the details below:

# Important disclaimer

Don't assume code in the repos represents work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different sets, helping to establish code standards and to build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] Apply this checklist to all new projects as step one
- [ ] A complete regression test suite in PyTest (until I can decide between that and unittest/Parameterized)
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
  - [ ] Specifically, would this benefit from comprehensive logging?
  - [ ] Would it benefit from a results page with stats to demonstrate accurate and complete results?
  - [ ] How do I want to manage output to stdout, stderr, file, etc?
  - [ ] How do comments and outputs help and assist one another without being redundant?
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization like PEP8 or Applying a PEP formatter to the code like Project Black.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [ ] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
- [ ] Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown which tell a code narrative. 
- [ ] For custom classes, create dunders as appropriate
- [ ] Make sure to include standard module comment headers
- [ ] Make good decisions relating to
  - [ ] Duck typing instead of type checking
  - [ ] Exceptions versus return values
  - [ ] Using idiomatic Python versus clarity of code
  - [ ] Having functions return values -- as a default-- have a good reason not to
  - [ ] More items will be added here

**_This will also serve as a template for the starting readme to do list for any new folders created under this one._**

  <summary>On code smells</summary>
# I know what code smells are

![Yoda doesn't like code smells](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/blob/master/media/code_smell.jpg "Stinks it does.")

**_I don't like code smells._**  

On the job, I'm ever-vigilant about them.

This is a repo I put together after a full day of work of software engineering in other languages.  On weekends, it was after a full work-week in other languages.  

I do this side-work because I love Python enough to spend my leisure time getting better at it.  

_Why do I have Python code up here with bad code smells?_

I want to demonstrate I can write a rough draft of Python code to do a variety of things.

Also, I am getting much better (some of this is Yoda-aged code for me!)  I do come back periodically and clean it up.  

Some of this code is just downright experimental:

* Some code is made in such a way as to stretch out what the code does along different axis.  The early drafts are to get the code working, and the later drafts will make it conform to expectations more in how it does that thing.
* Some code was written deliberately hard in order to be a puzzle for my writing skills.  I learn from these anti-patterns: in constructing the code and recognizing why it would be difficult to maintain.

In other words, this is my sandbox.  You get a peek inside what I'm curious about.  I move very fast and break a lot of things here, since I have limited evening and weekend time to move this work forward.  I focus on getting to green, and sometimes that means the code is not refactored when you check in.

**Code is only partly measured by how it performs as expected-- it should communicate, tell a story.**  

That's what I do during my work-day.   I make sure code can ship: it produces the right results, it has quality, and it tells a story for anyone else who might pick it up.  

As a manager and as a tech lead, I apply the same level of vigilance to it as I have over time in all the languages I've worked, and I would address the code during a work day when I'm still fresh (have coffee / tea in me).

Disclaimer:
Some of my better work is not on GitHub because it is protected by an obligation to one or more companies.

Thanks in advance for holding your nose!

  <summary>To do list for me to revise and move to issues as needed</summary>
  
- [ ] Move gists from old GitHub account to current one
- [ ] Standardize repos with best practices in Resources repo
